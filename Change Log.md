14/12/2024 The change log was moved to its own file. 

A new change log for bots being added and removed was created.

Bots are now required to be in 100 or more servers to be listed. Discord has made bot verification more lax and removed the 76 server limit.

User apps and invite links are now shown

2/12/2023 A second [Intake Server] was created to split bots on this list from bots being monitored. This was mainly done because of Discords 50 app limit for slash commands in servers.

2/27/2021 The change was made to remove non-verified for the sake of not wasting time in tracking down lots of very small bots
