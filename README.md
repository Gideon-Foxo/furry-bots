<h1 align="center">Limitations and Cavorts</h1>

> All server count is 'approximate' given that it is taken from Discord invites which is not live updating.

> Bot libraries might become out of date given the nature of development and rewrites. Bot libraries are only shown if that info can be found out publicly.

> User discriminators may not be up to date given the nature of Discord.

<h1 align="center">Change Log</h1>

2/12/2023 A second [Intake Server] was created to split bots on this list from bots being monitored. This was mainly done because of Discords 50 app limit for slash commands in servers.

2/27/2021 The change was made to remove non-verified for the sake of not wasting time in tracking down lots of very small bots.
